### 1.16.2

- Switches `BatchGetItem`'s threadpool to `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
  to work in AWS Lambda environments running Python 3.8+
- Adds `scripts/create_integration_test_table.py`; creates a DynamoDB table used
  for running integration tests

### 1.16.1

- Fix xoto3.lam.finalize for Python > 3.7

## 1.16.0

- `write_item` single item write helper for the `write_versioned`
  higher level DynamoDB transaction API. Suitable for any form of
  transactional write to a single item (creation/update/deletion).

### 1.15.1

Fixes to `versioned_transact_write_items`:

1. `presume` will now apply the standard dynamodb_prewrite transform,
   so that we don't get into situations where tuples aren't equal to
   lists, or floats aren't equal to Decimals, for instance. Anything
   presumed should look like an actual DynamoDB value, in other
   words. This oversight was leading to certain situations where
   presume was being used causing a superfluous write to the table.
2. The returned transaction will always include any items inserted
   into the transaction by `presume`, even if no effects were
   applied. This only occurred when a single item was presumed for the
   whole transaction and no changes were made to it, but it makes the
   API slightly easier to work with.

## 1.15.0

Changes to `versioned_transact_write_items`:

1. Any write to an item that leaves it in its pre-existing state
   (`==`) will perform only a ConditionCheck and not an actual
   Put/Delete on that item. This avoids having incrementing
   `item_version` when nothing was actually changed.
2. Single-item `versioned_transact_write_items` where the item is
   unchanged (`==`) performs no ConditionCheck and no spurious
   write. If you're not operating on multiple items, then there is no
   meaningful 'transactionality' to knowing whether the item was
   changed _after_ your transaction started, because transactions
   can't assert anything about the future - only about a conjunction
   between multiple items at a point in time.

## 1.14.0

`StackContext` and `OnCallDefault` utilities for providing new ways of
injecting keyword arguments across a call stack without polluting all
your function signatures in between.

### 1.13.1

Fix regression in `backoff` and associated implementation.

## 1.13.0

`LazyMulticast` - a ContextManager-based interface for
process-local multicasting of a producer.

`funnel_latest_from_log_group` - CloudWatch Logs funnel that composes
easily with the above.

`funnel_sharded_stream` - Genericized sharded stream funnel that
guarantees receiving subsequent writes. Previously existing DynamoDB
streams processor `process_latest_from_stream` uses this now.

### 1.12.2

Cover more exception types in retries for DynamoDB transaction utilities.

### 1.12.1

Update `all_items_for_next_attempt` to be able to handle multiple
tables with different key schemas

## 1.12.0

`TypedTable` - An enhanced API supporting the use of
`dynamodb.write_versioned.versioned_transact_write_items`, which is a
great way to write business logic against DynamoDB.

### 1.11.1

Change all Resources and Clients to use a thread-local Session to
avoid race conditions.

## 1.11.0

- Update `find_index` and `require_index` to allow for an index with no range key.

### 1.10.2

- Fixed `versioned_diffed_update_item` to support concurrent use with
  transactions.

### 1.10.1

- Fixed bug in `versioned_transact_write_items` where un-effected
  items would have an incorrect ConditionExpression generated, causing
  the transaction to fail.

## 1.10.0

- `versioned_transact_write_items` now allows the transaction builder
  itself to lazily load items from any table via `get`/`require`,
  instead of requiring all transacted items to be explicitly declared
  before the builder is invoked.
- Experimental support for optimistic creations and deletions as
  well - if an item being written has not been prefetched, it will be
  assumed to not exist for the purposes of the condition check in the
  Put or Delete within the transaction. If that optimism proves
  invalid, the transaction will be retried after a refetch of the
  actual item. The limitation is that we need to be able to somehow
  derive a key for your item, so either you need to have prefetched a
  different item from the same table, or your environment must allow
  access to the DescribeTable action for the DynamoDB table, so that
  we can directly check its key schema.

## 1.9.0

- New `versioned_transact_write_items` wrapper that presents a general
  purpose interface for versioned transactional Puts and Deletes
  across tables and items, reverting to simple versioned writes for
  cost optimization when only a single item is transacted.

## 1.8.0

- Improved utilities and types for CloudWatch Metrics.

### 1.7.1

- Safer long-polling default for the SQS poll utility.

## 1.7.0

- `versioned_diffed_update_item` more fully supports the use of the
  `nicename` keyword argument, providing more specific Exceptions in
  the case of the item not existing before the update.
- Improved typing for various query helpers in `xoto3.dynamodb.query`.

## 1.6.0

- FailedRecordExceptions now contain the entire exception for each
  failed record. This is a very minor feature.
- Removed some unnecessarily verbose logging to put library users back
  in control.

## 1.5.0

- `map_tree` now supports postorder transformations via keyword argument.

## 1.4.0

- Improved DynamoDB Item-related Exceptions for `GetItem`,
  `put_but_raise_if_exists`, and `versioned_diffed_update_item`.

### 1.3.3

- Allow any characters for attribute names in `add_variables_to_expression`.
  - We have a lot of snake_cased attribute names. We should be able to use this function with those.

### 1.3.2

- Addressed theoretical weakness in expression attribute naming by
  appending hashes of the raw attribute name rather than incrementing
  counts.

### 1.3.1

- addressed bug in `add_variables_to_expression` which was resulting in
  the generation of invalid queries.
- reverted behavior from `add_variables_to_expression` which might have
  resulted in queries being created with unreferenced dynamically suffixed
  AWS placeholders should an existing placeholder with the same name exist
  -- replaced with code to validate names instead.

### 1.3.0

- added `put_or_return_existing` utility.

### 1.2.1

- DynamoDB utilities now correctly use alphanumeric
  ExpressionAttributeNames. It would appear that DynamoDB only
  enforces this restriction selectively; we ran into it when trying to
  REMOVE an attribute during an update; SET does not seem to
  experience these issues.

## 1.2.0

- `build_update_diff` now also performs automatic type coercion on the
  'new' item in the case of datetimes, tuples, floats, and removing
  empty sets.

### 1.1.2

- Fixed bug in `versioned_diffed_update_item` preventing it from being
  used to create items that did not previously exist.
- Improved docstrings and documentation.

### 1.1.1

Within `xoto3.dynamodb`:

- Fixed `batch_write` imports.
- `versioned_diffed_update_item` now performs standard
  `boto3`-required data fixups on transformed items by default, but
  this behavior can be customized.
- Fixed return type of `put_unless_exists`
- Fixed cases where reserved words used as table primary key attribute
  names could cause `put_unless_exists` to fail with a
  ValidationException.

## 1.1.0

- Added `require_index` utility to `dynamodb.query`
- New, clearer name `page` to replace `From` in `dynamodb.query`. The
  previous name remains but is a deprecated alias.
- Made `dynamodb.batch_get.items_only` a bit more generic.

### 1.0.3

Fixed install_requires for Python > 3.6

### 1.0.2

Within `xoto3.dynamodb`:

- Fixed return value for `put_unless_exists`.
- Fixed type for `query.From`

### 1.0.1

Corrected naming in utility.
